Pandas I Choose You - Exercise 2 for my CSC103 Class

This program acts like a pokedex for the user.

Before using it, use the cleanup.py file to clean up two files so the program can work correctly.

Next, make a folder named data and the proceed to put in two new folders named orig and clean.
Put all the excel files provided in the orig folder and leave the clean folder empty.

After that, the program works by having the user select to search by name or region.

If selected to search by name, gives the user information back like name, locations and moves.

If selected to search by region, it asks the user to select a location from that specified region.

After that, the user can select to have the list of pokemon either in alphabetical order or
from strongest to weakest based on the highest level.
